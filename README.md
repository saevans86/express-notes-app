# Title 
EXPRESS-NOTE-APP



### Description 
The note app allows you to save and delete notes. 



### About
My motivation for this project was to really learn and lean into express as much as possible, as it's been one of the things I've looked forward to the most. As someone who spends quite a bit of time on their computer, this note app becomes very usefull when in class, or just jotting down reminders, and it also removes the need to use paper, and that's a win all on its own. Seeing how much this helped with school, and daily activities, it really made me want to take it a step further to make the app delete notes as well as save them even if the delete functionality wasn't a requirement. 

 Even with the base codes, the project was somewhat difficult going into it, but I feel like I'm getting the hang of it, and looking forward to using what I've learned to create projects entirely made by me.  The syntax feels similar, but it is much different that the base JS, which is furthering my understanding of different coding languages, and keeps my brain adaptable.  I definitely would have liked to incorporate more into the app itself like a date/calendar/edit function, so that may be something I implement in the future.

## Installation 
To use this app in VS code you will need express as well as the UUID package for setting unique ID's to the notes. Another useful tool is nodemon (Thanks CJ!)
Once you've forked the repo, and installed the necessary packages you can start nodemon by opening a terminal and typing in "nodemon start server.js" which will start/stop the local host automatically any time a change is detected, you can then navigate to your browser and open http://localhost:3001 which will bring you to the local version of this note app.

## Features 
The features of this app are to be able to save a note, recall the note, then delete the note. I think adding in a calendar function would further the apps usefulness!


## Tests 
No tests have been run at this time.
